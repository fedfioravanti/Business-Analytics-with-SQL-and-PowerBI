# Business Analytics with SQL and Power BI

![](images/00_cover.gif?raw=true)

## Overview

A sample project showing how to interact with a database using **SQLite**, **Pyhton** and **Power BI**.  
The Chinook database holds information about a digital music store and includes:  
- 11 tables
- A variety of indexes, primary and foreign key constraints
- Over 15,000 rows of data  


Below is the Chinook database Entity Relationship Diagram, which illustrates the relationships between the different tables.

After connecting and testing the database, we will answer some business questions using data associated with the store.  
Finally, we will export the database tables in CSV format, which will be used to create a semantic model in Power BI and related dashboards in the final step.  

Below is the table view of the semantic model recreated in Power BI.
